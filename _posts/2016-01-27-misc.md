Most netcat examples are with regular sockets, however, this utility
can be used to act as a client or server for **unix domain sockets**
by using the -U option:

    nc -U ./socketfile    # act as a client
    nc -l -U ./socketfile # act as a server (-l for listener)

In this example, socketfile is the filename for the socket.  It
appears in the file system but has a permission starting with 's',
e.g..  `srwxrwxrwx` Note: this should not be confused with fifos which
appear with permissions starting with 'p', `prwxrwxrwx`.

These commands worked when played opposite these python client and
server [examples](https://pymotw.com/2/socket/uds.html).

Question: can netcat passively monitor a socket connection to print
out any bidirectional traffic to STDOUT?
