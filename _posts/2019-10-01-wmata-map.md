A few years ago, Washington DC's transit authority, WMATA, released
a [programming interface](https://developer.wmata.com) for its bus and rail
system.  The API provides real-time position information for all
active buses and trains and is used by a number of apps.

The API returns the train positions as reported by sensors placed at
known locations on the tracks, every few hundred feet or so.  Since
portions of the train lines are below ground, GPS cannot locate train
positions, so these sensors are the best they can do.  Each sensor has
a number to identify it called a *track circuit identifier* which is
reported by the API for each active train.

No publicly released map of the circuit numbers is available.  The API
does provide the identifiers of neighboring track segments connected
to each track segment.  From this information it is possible to
construct a system-wide map of the circuit identifiers (see below,
[SVG version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contractdesign/wmata/master/doc/all.svg)).

On first inspection, assembling such a map might seem trivial, but as
it turns out, there are over 5000 circuit identifiers system-wide that
span four possible track types and five train lines, making the
problem similar to solving a large jigsaw puzzle.

I gave a short
[presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contractdesign/wmata/master/doc/presentation/metrohacks6_20161214_jpaz.pdf)
at a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/transportation-techies) on this
project in 2016 that has more information.  I used Python to interact
with the API and [graphviz](https://graphviz.org) to draw the diagram
below.  Interestingly, I discovered a few connector tracks that permit
trains to traverse independent lines, such as the single track line
from the red to green line.
