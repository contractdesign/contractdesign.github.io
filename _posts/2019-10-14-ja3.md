Salesforce created
[ja3](https://engineering.salesforce.com/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967)
to fingerprint TLS traffic with the idea of using it to characterize benign and
malicious traffic.  The original idea for this tool came from [Lee
Brotherston](https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/tls-fingerprinting) and was
presented at DerbyCon.

In this post, we walk through a test case where we use the tool to fingerprint
locally generated traffic.

# Steps

Download `ja3` from github.  `ja3` has bindings to many languages and tools, but
we are only interested in the Python version found in the `python/`
subdirectory.

    $ git clone https://github.com/salesforce/ja3
    $ ls python/ja3.py

Configure tcpdump to listen for HTTPS traffic.  There are `tcpdump` options to
[pare down](https://tlsfingerprint.io/pcap) the packet capture to record only
TLS client hellos, but we are not using them here for simplicity's sake.

    $ sudo tcpdump -A 'tcp port 443' -w curl_https.pcap

Generate TLS traffic,

    $ curl https://www.google.com

Kill the `tcpdump` session to stop recording and run the PCAP through `ja3` to
generate a digest,

    $ ./ja3.py --json curl_https.pcap
    {
        "destination_ip": "172.217.6.196", 
        "destination_port": 443, 
        "ja3": "771,4866-4867-4865-49196-49200-159-52393-52392-52394-49195-49199-158-49188-49192-107-49187-49191-103-49162-49172-57-49161-49171-51-157-156-61-60-53-47-255,0-11-10-13172-16-22-23-13-43-45-51-21,29-23-30-25-24,0-1-2", 
        "ja3_digest": "456523fc94726331a4d5a2e1d40b2cd7", 
        "source_ip": "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
        "source_port": 37316, 
        "timestamp": 1571059401.57057
    }

# Conclusion 

Let's look up our fingerprint (`"ja3_digest": "456..."`) in a
[database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salesforce/ja3/master/lists/osx-nix-ja3.csv).
Unfortunately for us, it's not found there.  We tried other
[databases](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3/tree/master/lists) to no avail.
Either the public databases are incomplete, or this version of `curl`
(7.58.0) is so new that it has never been characterized.  Maybe there are some
commercial databases that are more exhaustive.
