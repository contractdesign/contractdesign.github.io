HTTP allows headers (key/value pairs) to be added to a request.  Some of these
have specified meanings (e.g., `host`), while others are defined on an ad hoc basis.

Follow this [link]({{ site.url }}/request.php) to see the headers
seen in your request to this site.  Use this
[link]({{ site.url }}/request_json.php) for a JSON version.
