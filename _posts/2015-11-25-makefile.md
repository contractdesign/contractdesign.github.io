## Pattern Rules
Since suffix rules have been deprecated, [pattern rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html) should be used instead:

	%.o : %.c
		# rule defining how to make a file with .o suffix from a .c file

## Automatic Variables
Below are a few automatic variables commonly used in makefiles.  For others, check
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables)
before writing code to define your own.

	$@   filename of the target of the rule
	$<   the name of the first prerequisite
	$^   the name of all of the prerequisites with spaces between them
	$*   the stem with which the implicit rules matches


## Intermediate Objects
make removes intermediate objects by default.  To save them instead, add
the line:

	.PRECIOUS: %.o  # example for .o suffix files

This [stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15189704/makefile-removes-object-files-for-no-reason) presents several alternatives.

## Example: Simple Makefile
This makefile converts markdown to html.  Note that the intermediate file (suffix ihtml) will be automatically deleted by make.

	# turn off implicit rules
	.SUFFIXES:

	# turn off deletion of intermediate files (see .PRECIOUS above)
	.SECONDARY:

	%.html: %.ihtml
        tpage --define mdfile=$< main.tt > $@

	%.ihtml: %.md
        markdown $< > $@

	clean:
        rm -f *.ihtml *.html
