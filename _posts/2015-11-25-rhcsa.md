# Redhat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)

These are notes taken while viewing Von Vugt's videos for RHCSA certification.

## Chapter 6: Users and Groups

### Useful commands
To add a new user and switch to it

	> useradd <username>
	> su - <username>

/etc/group lists the group and members.  This file can be modified
directly, or these commands can be used:

	> groupadd <groupadd>
	> usermode -aG account <username>

## Chapter 12: Virtualization
### Prerequisites
Virtualization requires CPU support.  To verify a CPU is supported:

	> egrep 'vmx | svm' /proc/cpuinfo

To check that the KVM module is installed:

	> lsmode | grep kvm

To see if the virtual bridge has been set up for the VMs to share the NIC:

	> ip link show

Note that the virtual bridge has an address because it is operating in NAT mode:

	> ip addr show

### Commands
Here are a few useful commands:

	> virsh list # -all
	> virsh start small
	> virsh destroy small  # despite its name, it only stops the VM

The directory /etc/libvirt/qemu has an XML file with parameters for the VM.

	> virsh edit
