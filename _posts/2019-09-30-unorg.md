This page is a list of notes I took with [jrnl](https://jrnl.com).

* @code checked out `grumpy`, a Python to golang converter.  unable to get this to compile, consider using a Docker containerized version
* @q @cs how do docker and APT repositories work?
* @link @jupyter to run jupyter [remotely](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html#securing-a-notebook-server)
* @security make sure to check certificate fingerprints to ensure that the connection isn\'t being MITMed
* @tools @linux [cq](https://github.com/jolmg/cq) tool to query a CSV file with SQL.  it is a bash script that invokes sqlite

# Commands
* to list rules in a makefile: `make -qp`
* to remove a file that has been accidentally added: `git reset <FILE>`
* command to sniff network `strace â€“e trace=network,read,write /path/to/app args`

* (Windows) to show the wifi password for a running computer: `netsh wlan show profile Wifi-name key=clear`
