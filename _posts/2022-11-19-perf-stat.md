title: A First Foray into Linux Performance Monitoring (perf stat)
categories: linux
---

Linux has a tool (`perf stat`) that can record the instruction counts of a program (among many other stats). Let's try it on one of the simplest programs possible -- a program that returns an errorcode:

```C
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    return 0;
}
```

which corresponds to the assembly code (generated with `gcc -S`):
```assembly
main:
.LFB0:
	.cfi_startproc
	endbr64
	movl	$0, %eax
	ret
```

Running `perf stat` on even this simple program results in the execution of 646,399 instructions, even though there are only three effective instructions (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56905811/what-does-the-endbr64-instruction-actually-do) on `endbr64`)

Clearly, it's doing something other than the 3 instructions in the assembly. What's going on here? Are there boilerplate instructions included in this program that aren't visible to the disassembler? Does this include the instructions required to load the program? Why do the number of instructions vary from run to run?

```
 Performance counter stats for './a.out' (100 runs):

              0.26 msec task-clock                #    0.480 CPUs utilized            ( +-  3.53% )

                 0      cpu-migrations            #    0.000 /sec

           908,925      cycles                    #    3.117 GHz                      ( +-  2.89% )
           646,399      instructions              #    0.66  insn per cycle           ( +-  0.18% )
           128,260      branches                  #  439.859 M/sec                    ( +-  0.18% )
             3,388      branch-misses             #    2.58% of all branches          ( +-  1.60% )

         0.0005323 +- 0.0000176 seconds time elapsed  ( +-  3.31% )
```

I believe the linker is including the C runtime. Besides that, this program dynamically links in other libraries, including the `libc` dynamically linked library, although I don't understand how it's being used.

```bash
$ ldd ./a.out
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff86bd3000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7c95b0000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7c97c2000)
```

## Rewriting in x86 Assembly
Drawing inspiration from [elfbin](http://timelessname.com/elfbin/), where the author created a tiny "hello world" ELF binary, I rewrote the program in NASM to remove the need for a C runtime:

```assembly
BITS 64

section .text
global _start
_start:
    mov eax,1
    mov ebx,0
    int 80h
```
and assembled using
```bash
$ nasm -f elf64 simple.asm
$ ld simple.o -o ./a.out
$ strip -s ./a.out
```
I recorded only the *user* instructions, instead of the default which is to record both user and kernel
```bash
$ perf stat -r 100 -e instructions:u -o results.txt ./a.out
```
This time it only recorded 4 instructions. It's more than the expected 3, but maybe
the `int` instruction counts as 2 instructions. I like the fact that the instructions do not vary from run to run (while the execution time)
```
 Performance counter stats for './a.out' (100 runs):

                 4      instructions:u                                              

        0.00020050 +- 0.00000418 seconds time elapsed  ( +-  2.08% )
```

### Binary Before and After Strip
The ELF binary was run through `strip -s` to remove all symbols to keep the binary simple to understand. Below is the result of `readelf -a --wide` before and after running this command.

In case you aren't clear on the difference between segments and sections (I wasn't), the segment contains information needed during execution, while the sections contain information needed for linking. The diagram below illustrates the difference ([diagram source](https://web.archive.org/web/20171129031316/http://nairobi-embedded.org/040_elf_sec_seg_vma_mappings.html)). The primary difference is that the loader must know where to load the segments in memory and therefore needs the program header table, while the linker does not need this information. As an interesting side note, relocatable ELF do not have program headers either ([binaryexploitation](https://www.binaryexploitation.org/executable-formats/elf-format/elf-program-headers)).

![Diagram of Segments and Sections](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RMV0g.png "image Title")

`strip` removes the symbol table (`.symtab`) and its string table`.strtab` but leaves the program itself (`.text`) and the string table for the ELF header`.shstrtab`. The symbols aren't needed because nothing is linking against this binary. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64967077/distinguish-shstrtab-and-strtab-in-elf-file) has an explanation of the different string tables.

## Other Notes
`perf list` shows the available events possible to record on your system. The result depends on the counters present in your CPU.

To start `gdb` and stop at the first instruction, invoke the tool (`$ gdb ./a.out`) and enter `> start` as the first command.
